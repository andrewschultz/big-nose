WALKTHROUGH for Big Nose

This game shouldn't be nearly as hard as Q*Bert. But still, for those interested in how to do things quickly, or what is going on, here is a look-through:

Level 1

This is pretty straightforward, but it's a fun puzzle to try to minimize the steps you need. Let's let X be the number of unfilled squares in an odd row and Y be the number of unfilled squares in an even row. Then X=16 and Y=12. The first jump will make Y=11. So it looks like it will take at least 32 jumps. But we can do a bit better!

      x       1
     y y      2
    x x x     3
   y y y y    4
  x x x x x   5
 y y y y y y  6
x x x x x x x 7

se.se.se.se.se.se.ne and this takes care of 2 X's in a row. Note that we can't repeat this, since once the top is changed, it doesn't need to be changed again. But that cuts down the needed squares by one.

sw.se.se.se.se.se.nw.sw.nw.nw.nw.nw.sw.se.se.se.nw.sw.nw.nw.sw.se.nw.sw

That is 31 total moves.

So if you were wondering long ago if you were missing something by having to run back over squares, no, you weren't.

Level 2

Now let's make the value of each square the number of times Q*Bert has jumped on it. It starts at zero and goes to two.

So here we have a similar puzzle except we 24 X's and 32 Y's. Since the first jump is a Y and we alternate X's and Y's, That means at least 64 jumps ... minus the two where we can use discs to get back to the top to get 2 Y's in a row.

se.se.se.se.se.se.nw.se.ne (9)
se.se.se.se.ne (5, 14)

All right! Now for the rest.

sw.sw.ne.sw.sw.sw.ne.sw.sw.sw.ne.se.ne* (13, 27)

se.sw.ne.sw.ne*.se.ne.sw.ne.se.ne.sw.ne.se.ne.sw.ne.se.nw*.se.nw* (22, 49)

nw.nw.se.nw.nw.sw.ne.sw.sw.ne.se.ne.sw.ne.se (15, 64)

Level 3

We can't be quite as slick here, but we can get a good start by using the discs.

se.se.se.se.se.se.ne (7)
sw.se.se.se.se.se.se
nw.sw.nw.nw.nw.nw
sw.sw.sw.sw
ne.se.ne.se.ne.se
ne.ne

Now we have a problem with squares rather far away from each other, but ... we can link them up.

sw.sw.nw.sw.ne.se.ne.ne

se.se.ne.se.nw.sw.nw.nw

I'm not sure if this is completely minimal, but it shows how you need to link up squares far away.
