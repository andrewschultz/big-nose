WALKTHROUGH for Big Nose

This game shouldn't be nearly as hard as Q*Bert. But still, for those interested in how to do things quickly, or what is going on, here is a look-through:

Level 1

This is pretty straightforward, but it's a fun puzzle to try to minimize the steps you need. Let's let X be the number of unfilled squares in an odd row and Y be the number of unfilled squares in an even row. Then X=16 and Y=12. The first jump will make Y=11. So it looks like it will take at least 32 jumps. But we can do a bit better!

      x       1
     y y      2
    x x x     3
   y y y y    4
  x x x x x   5
 y y y y y y  6
x x x x x x x 7

se.se.se.se.se.se.ne and this takes care of 2 X's in a row. Note that we can't repeat this, since once the top is changed, it doesn't need to be changed again. But that cuts down the needed squares by one.

sw.se.se.se.se.se.nw.sw.nw.nw.nw.nw.sw.se.se.se.nw.sw.nw.nw.sw.se.nw.sw

That is 31 total moves.

So if you were wondering long ago if you were missing something by having to run back over squares, no, you weren't.

Level 2

Now let's make the value of each square the number of times Q*Bert has jumped on it. It starts at zero and goes to two.

So here we have a similar puzzle except we 24 X's and 32 Y's. Since the first jump is a Y and we alternate X's and Y's, That means at least 64 jumps ... minus the two where we can use discs to get back to the top to get 2 Y's in a row.

se.se.se.se.se.se.nw.se.ne (9)
se.se.se.se.ne (5, 14)

All right! Now for the rest.

sw.sw.ne.sw.sw.sw.ne.sw.sw.sw.ne.se.ne* (13, 27)

se.sw.ne.sw.ne*.se.ne.sw.ne.se.ne.sw.ne.se.ne.sw.ne.se.nw*.se.nw* (22, 49)

nw.nw.se.nw.nw.sw.ne.sw.sw.ne.se.ne.sw.ne.se (15, 64)

Level 3

We can't be quite as slick here, but we can get a good start by using the discs. The main thing to note is how to close out a square that necessarily is left behind when you go in a corner.

se.se.se.se.se.se.ne

sw.se.se.se.se.se

Now we're in a dead end.

nw.sw.nw.ne.se.nw.sw.sw.ne

This move helps us clear off a potential future bothersome corner square. So we can cut out even more.

nw.nw.nw.sw.se.se.sw.nw.nw.sw.se.nw.sw.ne

I can't prove this is minimal, but it seems very efficient. It looks like there will be two corner squares you have to leave for later.

36 moves is not too shabby.

Level 4

A similar strategy works here to cut out any squares that seem to get lost in the shuffle, but you just have to backtrack a bit more. Again, we can start with the corner stuff to get it out of the way.

se.se.se.se.se.se.nw.se.ne

se.se.se.se.ne

That's that for the top diagonal.
