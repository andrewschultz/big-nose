Big Nose on the Big Pyramid

WARNING: contains randomized pretend swearing.

Release 1 was a 2022 April Fool's joke, sort of, inspired by the IF Arcade Pack, itself an April Fool's joke.

Originally created December 22, 2011, with levels 5/6 only, and shoved in a dark bin somewhere for a LOOOONG time.

Release 2 was on April 5, 2022, with a lot of changes I realized would help the player without spoiling anything. An ABOUT section was added, along with adding responses to other numpad keys.

Oh, I also somehow left release 1 in final-level mode, too.

Which was, apparently, what the first draft was intended to be, until I realized the player might want a chance to ramp up.

This game has 6 levels and thus an opportunity to get familiar with what's going on:

* B-C

* A-B-C

* B-C-B-C

* A-B-C-B-C

* B-C-A-B-C-A

* B-C-A-B-C-A with a twist.

Level 6 seems frustrating. But is it impossible?
